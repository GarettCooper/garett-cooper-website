# garett-cooper-website

This is the git repository for my personal website, which isn't hosted publicly anywhere while I work on it.

Q: Isn't building a mostly static webpage that is little more that an online version of a résumé with a heavyweight framework like React complete overkill? 

A: Yes, yes it is. But I also want something to demonstrate competence with a modern frontend framework for potential employers to look at, so this will have to do.
